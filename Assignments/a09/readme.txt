Fill in the self-evaluation in the following evaluation grid.
Symbols:  A - Assignment, Q - Question, T - Task
Field format: [self-evaluation/total marks/marker's evaluation]

For example, you put your self-evaluation, say 2, like [2/2/*]. 
If markers give different evaluation value, say 1, it will show 
[2/2/1] in the marking report.
